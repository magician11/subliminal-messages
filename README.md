# Subliminal Messages

I just felt like experimenting with subliminal messages. The idea is to use [subliminal stimuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli) to bypass conscious filters to get your brain to process the message as an instruction.

This app will very quickly display a random message at a random location on the screen.

Timing values are based off the [subliminal message generator found on Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5270800A/en).

## Usage

- Edit `messages.js` with whatever messages you would like to see.
- Open index.html in a browser
